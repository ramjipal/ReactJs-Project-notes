# How It All Flows Together

## index.html:
- Browser loads this file.
- The `<div id="root"></div>` acts as the placeholder for the React application.

## index.jsx:
- React application starts here.
- The `ReactDOM.createRoot` mounts the `App` component (from `main.jsx`) into the `#root` div in `index.html`.

## main.jsx:
- Defines the main app structure.
- Includes components like `<Header />` and other content.

## Header.jsx:
- A reusable React component rendered by `main.jsx`.
